<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hey! My name is Steven and I am a computer scientist currently doing my master's degree with a focus on <i>Data and Knowledge Management</i> at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. 
I am especially interested in:
<ul>
  <li><i>Event-driven architectures</i></li>
  <li><i>(Distributed) Complex event processing</i></li>
  <li><i>Streaming algorithms (e.g., probabilistic data structures)</i></i>
</ul> 

In addition, I am a theoretical computer science enthusiast, whereby I am particularly interested in topics concerning: 
<ul>
  <li><i>Automata theory and Formal languages</i></li>
  <li><i>{Parameterized, Fine-grained, Descriptive} Complexity theory</i></li>
  <li><i>NP-hard optimization problems</i></li>
  <li><i>Problems in NP ∩ coNP without polynomial-time solutions (I share Jack Edmonds opinion: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Jack.Edmonds.jpg">NP ≠ NP ∩ coNP = P</a>)</i></li> 
  <li><i>Graph theory</i></li>
</ul>

I am inquisitive and delighted to help new students get started in their studies, trying to convey the same passion for computer science that I have within me. I teach to learn better.<p>
When I am not sitting in front of the computer, I like to spend time hiking (with my<a href="https://spurtzel.github.io/assets/img/chew.jpg"> dog</a>), swimming, drinking tea or hanging out with friends.<p>
Thank you for stopping by, and please always feel welcome to contact me! :)
