Hey! My name is Steven and I am a computer scientist currently doing my master's degree with a focus on <i>data and knowledge management</i> at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. 
I am especially interested in:
- <i>event-driven architectures</i>  
- <i>distributed complex event processing</i>.

In addition, I am a theoretical computer science enthusiast, whereby I am particularly interested in topics concerning: 
<ul>
  <li><i>automata theory and formal languages</i></li>
  <li><i>(parameterized) complexity theory</i></li>
  <li><i>graph algorithms</i>
</li>
</ul>
