<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hey! My name is Steven and I am a computer scientist currently doing my master's degree with a focus on <i>data and knowledge management</i> at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. 
I am especially interested in:
<ul>
  <li><i>event-driven architectures</i></li>
  <li><i>(distributed) complex event processing</i></li>
  <li><i>streaming algorithms (e.g. probabilistic data structures)</i></i>
</ul> 

In addition, I am a theoretical computer science enthusiast, whereby I am particularly interested in topics concerning: 
<ul>
  <li><i>automata theory and formal languages</i></li>
  <li><i>(parameterized) complexity theory and fine-grained complexity</i></li>
  <li><i>graph theory</i></li>
</ul> 

I am inquisitive and very happy to help new students get started in their studies, trying to convey the same passion for computer science that I have within me. I teach to learn better.
<p>
When I'm not sitting in front of the computer, I like to spend time hiking (with my<a href="https://spurtzel.github.io/assets/img/chew.jpg"> dog</a>), swimming, drinking tea or hanging out with friends.

Thank you for stopping by and please always feel welcome to contact me! :)
