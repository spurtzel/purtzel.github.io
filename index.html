<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hey! My name is Steven and I am a 1st year PhD student at Prof. Dr. Weidlich's working group at Humboldt University of Berlin. <br\> <br\>
My research focuses on:
<ul>
  <li><i>Event stream processing, e.g., $($distributed$)$ complex event processing</i></li>
  <li><i>Probabilistic data structures, e.g., designing summaries and sketches</i></li>
  <li><i>Learning-based algorithms, e.g., using prediction oracles</i></i>
</ul> 

In addition, I am a theoretical computer science enthusiast, whereby I am particularly interested in topics concerning: 
<ul>
  <li><i>Automata theory and Formal languages</i></li>
  <li><i>{Parameterized, Fine-grained, Descriptive} complexity theory</i></li>
  <li><i>Solving NP-hard optimization problems, i.e., exact and approximation algorithms</i></li>
  <li><i>Problems in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:N#npiconp">NP ∩ coNP</a> without known polynomial-time algorithms (I share Jack Edmonds view: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Jack.Edmonds.jpg">NP ≠ NP ∩ coNP = P</a>)</i></li> 
  <li><i>Graph theory</i></li>
</ul> 
I am inquisitive and delighted to help new students get started in their studies, trying to convey the same passion for computer science that I have within me. I teach to learn better.<p>
When I am not sitting in front of the computer, I like to spend time hiking (with my<a href="https://spurtzel.github.io/assets/img/chew.jpg"> dog</a>), swimming, drinking tea or hanging out with friends.<p>
Thank you for stopping by, and please always feel welcome to contact me! :)
