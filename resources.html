On this page, I collect all the resources that have fascinated me over the years and have brought me further.
<br>
<br>
<b>YouTube</b>
<ul>
  <li><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/leifaktor">NLogSpace</a> - In my opinion, this is the best german-language channel for an introduction to theoretical computer science.</i></li>
  <li><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mitocw/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=5">MIT OpenCourseWare - Computer Science</a> - High-quality educational videos on a wide range of computer science topics. Especially Erik Demaine is great!</i></li>
  <li><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeufsDAkY633Ap4zyNHZVA"> code〈metas〉</a> - New YouTube channel of a very good friend for getting started with algorithms, data structures, and programming (mainly C++) with a particular focus on algorithmic thinking (e.g., when is which data structure suitable?). </i></li>
</ul>
